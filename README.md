Help the Stanford AI Lab team analyse a dataset of 50,000 film reviews so they can automatically determine the sentiment of new comments and statements online. In particular, they are keen to identify the most positive and negative statements among the millions of neutral comments - this will enable them to share the most positive ones, and for the most negative ones, they will be able to react and respond before such comments reach a wider audience.
